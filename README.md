# Vocabulary_matching
This is a vocabulary matching problem where you match terms of the same meaning. We have two different sources reporting data; source 1 and source 2. The two sources use different methods of assigning names to the commodity terms. We are going to align these two different data sources;  whenever the same agricultural commodity appears in both sources, match them and represent them as a pair. The two sources are of different sizes; and thus not all terms have corresponding pairs. You may notice that some terms in source 1 are not expressed in perfect English.
